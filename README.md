# Redocly landing page gallery

Welcome to Redocly's Landing page gallery!
This this repo contains a collection of example landing pages built using React and related tooling.

Run the project to preview the pages or explore the code to learn how to build your own React pages.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to Markdown pages, the following Redocly products allow you to build custom pages with React: [Realm](https://redocly.com/realm), [Revel](https://redocly.com/revel), and [Reef](https://redocly.com/reef).

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the development server and preview the landing pages:

1. Clone the repo

2. Run `npm install` inside the project.

3. Run `npm run start` to start the project.

4. Click the **Preview URL** in the console.

## Project structure

Each landing page is self-contained in it's own folder, including any resources needed for that page.

Dependencies are managed from the central `package.json` file.

## Requests

Let us know if there's a specific page or React-based tool you'd like an example of.
Open an issue and describe the example you'd like to see.
We may add it in the future.
